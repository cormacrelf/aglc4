            It's not possible under CSL-M as it stands to detect when parties'
            names were merely reversed and apply subsequent decision grouping.
            It is also not possible to manually force suppression of parties'
            names for a single cite.

            So, for now, you should attach a hypothetical `Philcox v King`
            short citation as a suffix to the first one.

          Why? The bracketed portion is subtly different from other case
          citation types; it includes both authors and a docket number (if
          present). Therefore you can't achieve this with only a prefix.
          Without a checkbox for 'transcript' in Juris-M, the next best option
          is to use the presence of an otherwise useless field as a marker.
