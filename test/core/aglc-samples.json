Certainly, a key role of government has been to set labour standards through legislation, or by establishing legal systems of industrial relations whereby conflicts between employers and unions are resolved and there is a mechanism for determination of appropriate rights and standards for employers and employees. Recently, however, a number of developments - including criticisms of labour law's capacity to accommodate flexibility in employment practices at the level of the firm (often referred to as a need for labour market deregulation), questions about the effectiveness of legally prescriptive and hierarchical models of regulation, and a growth in corporate power - have converged to shift attention to other ways in which the state may influence labour standards and practices. Increasing attention (particularly in Europe and the United States) has been paid to the use by states of soft or light touch approaches to regulating labour standards. Such regulatory approaches are yet to receive extensive consideration as forms of state labour regulation in Australian labour law scholarship.","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=961528","number":"40","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Howe","given":"John"},{"family":"Landau","given":"Ingrid"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,17]]},"title-short":"'Light Touch' Labour Regulation by State Governments in Australia"},

She wrote to those she had met and connected with as her role took her from palaces to outback schools, from war zones to memorials, from intimate audiences to lavish ceremonies. She received even more letters from every corner of the country. Generous, witty and always heartfelt, her letter-writing skills were honed at boarding school, from where she would write to her parents every Sunday. Dear Quentin is a rich collection of the letters the Governor-General wrote and received during her six-year term to prime ministers Rudd and Gillard, VC Mark Donaldson, pals Anne Summers and Wendy McCarthy, Indigenous elders, war vets, Girl Guides, grandchildren, as well as the proud owner of a calf called Quentin.
